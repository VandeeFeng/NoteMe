A while ago, I came across an interesting concept proposed by AK: Generative GUI.

More about this: https://github.com/vandeefeng/gitmemo/issues/61

I decided to give it a try just for fun.

All the codes are generated by cursor with claude.

This project provide a TUI like page to generate UI components by typing prompts.

This is how I envision an AI-powered notebook should be.

NoteMe means: not me.

I believe the purpose of taking notes was never about the act itself, but about shaping a better version of ourselves.

Question yourself, accept yourself, transcend yourself, become yourself.
